The Main objective of this ETL testing project is to migrate the Data from DB2 Database to Oracle 
The teamm used informatica for mappings and then migrated the tables.
As a Test Lead I was involved in the Requirement gathering phase and understood the table mappings, 
Created the the test scenarios and test cases for before and after migration processes.
the test cases were created to make sure the count of tables and the records are matching in the dource and target tables.
Also the records and data is tested in the target tables according to the column mappings in the requirement specifications
The Test results are captured and uploaded in to HP ALM
HP ALM was used for Defect life cycle management, Test Management and Tracebility

Tools used: Toad, SQl developer, HP ALM
